Here\\'s the basic idea:\\n\\n1. Draw a square and a circle on a piece of paper.\\n2. Generate random points within the square.\\n3. Count the proportion of points that fall within the circle.\\n4. The ratio of points within the circle to the total number of points is approximately equal to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square, which is pi.\\n\\n**Mathematical Formulation**\\n\\nLet\\'s denote the following variables:\\n\\n*   `N`: the number of random points generated\\n*   `n`: the number of points within the circle\\n*   `pi_approx`: the approximated value of pi\\n\\nThe formula to calculate pi is:\\n\\n`pi_approx = (4 * n) / N`\\n\\n**Python Code**\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple Python code snippet to calculate pi using the Monte Carlo method:\\n\\n```python\\nimport random\\nimport math\\n\\ndef calculate_pi(num_points):\\n    # Generate random points within the square (-1, -1) to (1, 1)\\n    points_inside_circle = 0\\n    for _ in range(num_points):\\n        x, y = random.uniform(-1, 1), random.uniform(-1, 1)\\n        # Check if the point falls within the circle (radius 1)\\n        if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:\\n            points_inside_circle += 1\\n\\n    # Calculate pi using the Monte Carlo method\\n    pi_approx = (4 * points_inside_circle) / num_points\\n    return pi_approx\\n\\nnum_points = 1000000\\npi_approx = calculate_pi(num_points)\\nprint(f\"Approximated pi: {pi_approx}\")\\nprint(f\"Difference between approximated pi and actual pi: {abs(pi_approx - math.pi)}\")\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: The more points you generate, the more accurate the approximation will be.\\n\\n**Limitations**\\n\\nThis method has a few limitations:\\n\\n'"

However, these methods are not practical for obtaining a high degree of accuracy.\\n\\nA more practical approach is to use the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) formula, which is a spigot algorithm that allows us to calculate any digit of pi without having to compute the preceding digits.\\n\\nAnother method is to use the Chudnovsky algorithm, which is a fast and efficient method for calculating pi to a high degree of accuracy.\\n\\nFor simplicity, we can use the first few terms of the BBP formula to estimate pi:\\nœÄ = 3 + 1/(4/3 - 1/(4/3 - 1/(4/3 - ...))\\n\\nLet's use this simplified formula to estimate pi:\\n\\nœÄ ‚âà 3 + 1/(4/3) ‚âà 3 + 1.3333 ‚âà 4.3333\\n\\nNow, let's add the next term:\\nœÄ ‚âà 4.3333 + 1/(4/3 - 1/(4/3)) ‚âà 4.3333 + 1/(1.3333 - 0.3333) ‚âà 4.3333 + 0.6667 ‚âà 5.0000\\n\\nNext term:\\nœÄ ‚âà 5.0000 + 1/(1.3333 - 1/(1.3333 - 1/(1.3333))) ‚âà 5.0000 + 1/(0.6667 - 0.3333) ‚âà 5.0000 + 0.3333 ‚âà 5.3333\\n\\nContinuing this process, we can obtain more accurate approximations of pi.
